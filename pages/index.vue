                <strong>Practice:</strong> Play as many games as you want, with the ability to make it easier or harder by controlling the ragne of numbers allowed and even how many numbers a game board has.

            <p>
                <strong>Countdown:</strong> Starting with 60 seconds, get as many points as possible before the time runs out. The better you do, the more time is added to the countdown.
